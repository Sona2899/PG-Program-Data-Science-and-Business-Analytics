# State-wise Health Income Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
Analyze state-level health and income data to identify distinct groups of states based on income patterns. The objective is to reduce data dimensionality while retaining maximum variance and apply clustering techniques to uncover meaningful groupings.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group states with similar income characteristics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dimensionality, followed by clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings and derive insights.

## 🧠 Key Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Data scaling and preparation  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA (95% variance explained)  
- Clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical methods  
- Interpretation and profiling of state clusters  

## 🧰 Skills & Tools Covered
- Python  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering  

## 📈 Outcome
- Reduced high-dimensional data while preserving key information  
- Identified distinct clusters of states based on income patterns  
- Provided insights to support policy analysis and regional decision-making
