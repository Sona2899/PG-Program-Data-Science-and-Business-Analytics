# Trade & Ahead - Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Optimize stock portfolios for Trade & Ahead's clients by conducting cluster analysis on stock price and financial indicator data. The goal is to identify distinct stock groups with similar characteristics to help build diversified portfolios that balance risk and return, enhancing investment performance and mitigating potential losses.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group stocks with similar financial characteristics. Clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering are used after proper data scaling and preprocessing. Cluster evaluation metrics like Silhouette Score and Cophenetic Correlation are applied to validate the results, and dimensionality reduction helps visualize the clusters effectively.
